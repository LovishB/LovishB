## Hi there 👋
Experienced Senior Software Developer with expertise in backend development and blockchain technologies. Passionate about building innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of web3.

🚀 Backend Dev:
- Node.js (Express & NestJS are my jam)
- REST APIs & GraphQL queries that don't quit
- Docker? I containerize in my sleep

🔗 Blockchain Alchemy:
- EVM
- Smart contracts using solidity
- DApps
- ETHGlobal hackathon hoarder (trophies, not NFTs... yet)

🛠️ Tool Belt:
Node.js, Express, NestJS, REST, GraphQL, Docker, Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js, and a dash of chaos.

🏆 Cool Stuff I Did:
- Launched blockchain projects that even my grandma uses (okay, maybe not, but they're cool)
- Hackathon hero (Recently won two web3 hackathons)

If you need someone to turn ideas into code or explain blockchain to your gradma, I'm your dev. Let's build something awesome... or at least something that compiles!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
